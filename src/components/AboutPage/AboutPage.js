        <p>My name is Tia Rose and I am an early-career Software Developer. After the death of George Floyd, I was sick and tired of seeing black lives being prematurly taken by brutal and violent police officers. I created this webpage to remember those we lost from 2010 - 2020. My hope is that this webpage can be used to remind others of those we lost and remember them not only of how they died, but how they lived.</p>
        <p>If this website gets enough traction I would love to expand it to remember those we lost pre-2010. I also hope to  have the ability to create personal webpages for each indivual whose lives were taken by violent police officers.</p>
